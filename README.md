# Frigate-Telegram

This project is a Telegram bot integration for Frigate, an open-source NVR (Network Video Recorder) software. It allows users to receive real-time alert notifications from their Frigate instance directly in Telegram.

The application is written in Node.js and polls the Frigate API to fetch new events. When a new event is detected, it is forwarded to Telegram, including several event details, the event clip url and a thumbnail.
This project aims to retrieve events from Frigate using its API without relying on external tools like Home Assistant. MQTT is not supported.

The application polls Frigate every 60 seconds -by default- to fetch new alerts. The GET request to the Frigate API retrieves events from the last 60 seconds, filtered by the parameters specified in the `docker-compose` file (label, camera, and zones). You can customize it with `POLLING_INTERVAL`: it will set the same value for both application `polling interval` and frigate `after`.
